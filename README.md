# landing-page(Liminal)
This project helped me to practice combining HTML and CSS in ways that are not able to be explained easily. Throughout the design of a webpage each element, and any modification to it, can affect the neighboring element's position. So pre planning and proper structure, in this case using Flexbox, is important for efficiency. The more consise the boxes the less time spent targeting minor alignment issued using padding, margin, etc. Properly understanding and implementing Flexbox tools such as Flex-grow/shrink/basis is crucial to success.
